# PRIVACY & ETHICS — LineLight‑1

- **Local‑only**: The device analyzes audio energy on the fly and **stores nothing**. No recording, no telemetry.
- **Legibility**: The lamp **is** the status—if it glows, sensing happens. Add a small front LED if you need a separate power indicator.
- **Auditability**: Publish the full schematic and firmware so users can review claims and modify behavior.
- **Consent by design**: It’s a **through‑device**, not a logger. If you ever add logging, it must be opt‑in, off by default, and clearly indicated.
- **Right to repair**: Use accessible parts, socket the op‑amp, and label test pads.
