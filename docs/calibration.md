# Calibration

1. Feed **pink noise** or a well‑mixed reference track.
2. Turn **POT1** to set the low‑edge bin; **POT2** for high‑edge.
3. Watch the serial readout: it prints the band in Hz. Aim for your target area (e.g., 50–120 Hz for kick).
4. If the lamp pegs or is too shy across tracks, the AGC will adapt—but you can tweak `target` and `alpha` in code.
5. Optional: add a hidden pushbutton and store the current band to EEPROM.
