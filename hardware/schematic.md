# Schematic (placeholder)

This folder will hold the KiCad/EasyEDA sources. For now, see **docs/build-guide.md** for the reference hookups.

Recommended symbols/footprints:
- Audio TRS jacks with switched normals (if you add mute/bypass).
- MCP6002 in SOIC‑8 with DIP‑8 footprint option (adapter) for easy replacement.
- Test pads: SUM, ADC, 5V, GND, D9.
